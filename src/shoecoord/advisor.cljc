  "Shoemaking Workshop Coordination Advisor — proposing a workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a work record,
  schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  leather/sole/adhesive-materials supply order) from a crew roster,
  workshop registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `shoecoord.governor`
  independently gates every proposal and always escalates safety
  concerns and above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never
  proposes to directly finalize a shoemaking-execution decision (e.g.
  deciding to proceed with a specific cutting operation), or a
  workshop-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring the workshop
  safety cleared for operation), and never proposes to override a shop
  safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-7522's
  cabinetcoord.advisor.

   Never propose an op outside this closed list, and never propose to
