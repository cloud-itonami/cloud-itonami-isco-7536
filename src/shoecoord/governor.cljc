(ns shoecoord.governor
  "ShoeCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating every
  workshop scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may make for a
  shoemaking crew. The governor never dispatches hardware itself,
  never performs shoemaking work itself, and never finalizes a
  shoemaking-execution decision (e.g. deciding to proceed with a
  specific cutting operation) or a workshop-safety-clearance decision
  (e.g. declaring the workshop safety cleared for operation), and
  never overrides a shop safety officer's judgment — those are
  permanently out of this actor's scope and remain a shop safety
  officer's exclusive judgment (README's 'Robotics premise': this
  actor coordinates WORKSHOP SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  performs shoemaking work itself). Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7522's cabinetcoord.governor.

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. maker provenance      — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. workshop provenance   — the workshop site must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs shoemaking work
                                itself; it only gates what the advisor
                                may coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                shoemaking-execution decision (e.g.
                                deciding to proceed with a specific
                                cutting operation), or a workshop-
                                safety-clearance decision (e.g.
                                declaring the workshop safety cleared
                                for operation), or to override a shop
                                safety officer's judgment, is a hard,
                                permanent block (checked both against
                                the proposed :op and, defense-in-
                                depth, against the proposal's
                                :rationale text — matched as full
                                finalization/execution ACTION phrases
                                such as \"finalize the cutting
                                operation\" / \"declare the workshop
                                safety cleared\" / \"override the shop
                                safety officer's judgment\", never as
                                bare nouns like \"leather\", \"sole\",
                                \"adhesive\" or \"shoe\", so the check
                                can never self-trip on the advisor's
                                own routine rationale text, e.g.
                                \"logged work record for maker …\" or
                                \"scheduled crew operation for
                                shoemaking task …\" or \"…routed for
                                shop safety officer review\" — all
                                three legitimately contain those bare
                                nouns but none is a finalization
                                action, and all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a cutting-tool-hazard / adhesive-
                                fume-exposure / equipment-condition
                                concern always escalates to a human,
                                never auto-commits).
    7. :op :coordinate-supply-order above `supply-cost-threshold`.
    8. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`).

  This actor coordinates workshop scheduling/logistics ONLY — it
  never performs shoemaking work itself, and it never makes a
  workshop-safety-clearance decision itself; those decisions always
  route to a human shop safety officer, either via a hard permanent
  block on the op-allowlist (rules 4/5 above) or via a mandatory
  escalation (rule 6 above)."
