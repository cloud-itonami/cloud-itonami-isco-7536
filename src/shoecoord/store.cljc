  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7536 shoemakers workshop scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling,
  job/commission/progress-record logging and leather/sole/adhesive-
  materials supply-order coordination for a shoemaking crew under this
  advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches hardware itself, never
  performs shoemaking work itself, and never finalizes a
  shoemaking-execution decision or a workshop-safety-clearance
  decision, and never overrides a shop safety officer's judgment —
  those remain the shop safety officer's exclusive judgment). Modeled
  closely on cloud-itonami-isco-7522's cabinetcoord.store.

  Domain:

    maker    — a registered shoemaking crew member (:maker-id,
              :name)
    workshop — a registered shoemaking workshop site {:workshop-id
              :name :max-supply-cost number}. `:max-supply-cost` is an
              informational registered ceiling used only to decide
              whether a `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates
              to human sign-off (the governor never blocks a
              within-threshold order outright; it only decides
              commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged job/commission/
              progress entry, a scheduled crew/task operation, a
              flagged safety concern, or a coordinated leather/sole/
              adhesive-materials supply order) — written ONLY via
              commit-record!.
    ledger   — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
